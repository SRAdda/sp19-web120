 <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>

 <h3>Adopt a Rescue</h3>
 <img src="images/tablet.jpg" class="tablet" alt="Cute group of Dogs" />
 <p>I adore dogs and smile whenever I see one. Dogs are amazing for the fact they have an inate ability to pacify humans. There are those that never had the good fortune of a loving person to take care of them, so they developed bad behavior out of fear. Whenever someone adopts a rescue, another creature of the earth has the opportunity to give his new person a huge amount of emotional support.</p>
 <p>I highly encourage you to try it!</p>
